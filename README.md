# Gibbs-Sampling
Here I take DNA sample inputs from the user. Then I take an input for lengths of the two motifs that the user wants to find. Then through the different functions in the class (function descriptions are present below), I give an output for possible motifs in each sequence with a particular score and frequency in all the other sequences.
